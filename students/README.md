# Students Directory

This directory is for student work and practice files.

## Getting Started
1. Create your own files here
2. Practice Git commands with these files
3. Experiment with different Git workflows
4. Don't worry about making mistakes - that's how you learn!

## Suggested Practice Files
- `my-first-commit.txt` - Your first Git commit
- `feature-branch-work.js` - Practice with branches
- `merge-request-demo.md` - Practice with MRs
- `environment-test.js` - Practice with environment variables

## Remember
- Use `git status` frequently to check your repository state
- Commit often with meaningful messages
- Create branches for new features
- Never commit sensitive information (passwords, API keys, etc.)
- Ask questions if you're unsure about anything!

Happy learning! ðŸš€
